Deep learning is a way of leveraging convolutional neural networks for training models to solve our problems. As I evolve in my career, leveraging my strong biology foundational training and my acquired computational biology and bioinformatic skills. I envision that deep learning can be a powerful tool for me to use to model and slve complicated biological problems. FASTAI was one of the first complete frameworks made in 2020, at the beginning of the deep learning revolution. It is therefore a perfect companion for learning, practising and developing my own deep learning projects. This repository has all my notes, blogs and projects accumulated through my deep learning journey.
